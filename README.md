## User Story

As a Developer I want to understand the semantic structure of HMTL and its relationship to CSS so that I can successfully accomplish the refractoring process for potential clients.

## Lessons Learned

The Horiseon landing page did not have a functioning "Search Engine Optimization"link in the navigation bar. No only did the refactoring process help me identify the missing id tag, it also helped me practice consolidation on the css stylesheet. I was able to reorginize the stylesheet to follow the semantic structure of the index.html as well as apply proper semantic elements to meet SEO standards.
